                <p class="bio">I was born in Benbrook Texas growing up with my best friend Oz. I am currently going to the University of North Texas majoring in Computer Science, on contract with the U.S. Army, and hoping to work as a Cyber Operations Officer. Here I met two good friends, Sam and Reagan in one of my classes. I have visited and seen many beautiful places so I would like to work to preserve natural environments from harmful wastes.</p>

                <p class="bio">I’m a student at the University of North Texas, where I am currently majoring in Computer Science. When I moved to Denton I became very passionate about recycling, since it wasn’t as easy to do where I previously had lived. I had the idea of making a website about recycling before enrolling in this class and found this class to be the perfect opportunity to try it out. Now we are able to encourage UNT students to recycle around campus, while also being rewarded for their efforts.</p>

                <p class="bio">Hello, I’m currently a computer science student at the University of North Texas. While pursuing my degree, I have been looking for ways to make a positive impact on the environment. Because of our shared passion, my friends and I are excited to share our recycling web app to our college community. As someone who grew up around computers, I’m conscious of the importance of managing data to solve complex problems. That is why I decided to use my skills to encourage positive waste management exercises.</p>
